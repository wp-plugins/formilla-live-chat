== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install Formilla.com Live Chat software to my WordPress site? =
Follow our [quick installation video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qodtXvmpdg "quick installation video") tutorial or the Installation tab of this page.


= How do I start a test chat after installing Formilla Live Chat on my WordPress site? =
Watch our [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwy1VnSp3EA "video tutorial") to learn how.


= What is the Formilla 'Chat ID' under the WordPress plugin settings? =
The Chat ID is the unique identifier for your particular live chat widget. Your live chat widget won't display on your WordPress website unless you have a Chat ID entered on the settings page.  You will receive this ID via email upon registering with Formilla.com via the **Formilla Chat** link on your WordPress admin panel.


= Can I specify my hours of operation or simply that I am unavailable to chat? =
Access your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat** **-->** **View Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and modify the hours of operation from the **Advanced Options** tab.


= Can I receive an email notification when my customers use the 'Email us' button while I'm offline from chat? = 
Yes, the Email Notifications option is enabled by default for every Formilla.com Live Chat widget you create. Removing the email address(es) on the Advanced Options tab of the live chat widget configuration page disables the feature. Alternatively, you may add additional email recipients by simply comma-separating each email address.  You can respond to emails using your preferred email client, or directly from the Formilla.com Customer Inbox help desk.


= I've followed all the instructions but I still appear offline and see the "Email us" button on my site. How do I go online and get the button to say "Chat with us"? =
If you're using the Live Chat web interface, it behaves just like any chat client; you must login to Formilla.com (the chat client) via your **WordPress Admin Panel --> Formilla Chat** menu item, or directly at Formilla.com in a new browser window. Once you've logged in and navigated to the **Live Chat --> Live Chat Now** page, you're considered online and ready to accept chats. If you log off, your button will go to offline mode and display "Email us". If you're using Google Talk instead of the live chat web interface, simply log into your preferred chat client for either service and Formilla.com will recognize you're online and display "Chat with us" after a few seconds.  


= How do I appear offline so that customers cannot chat with me during that time? =
If you are currently not available to chat, just sign out of your Formilla.com Live Chat account and you will not receive any live chats during this time.  We took a very simple approach to appearing online versus offline for live chat.  If you are using Google Talk via Formilla.com Live Chat instead, simply sign out of your preferred client and Formilla.com will automatically update your status.      


= Is there a way for me to deactivate my live chat WordPress button momentarily without removing the plugin? =
Yes.  Access your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat --> View Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and **uncheck** the **Active Widget** option on the **Widget Details** tab.  This will simply hide the live chat button from your wordpress site.  Once ready, just **check** the same box and save for the button to re-appear. 


= How do I configure Google Talk (gtalk/gchat) instead of using the Formilla.com Live Chat standard offering? =
Start with our [Google Talk setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhL_WIOKa48 "Google Talk setup") video.  Setup Google Talk by accessing your Formilla.com Live Chat account and navigate to **Account Settings --> Manage Users** and select the edit icon for the appropriate account. Under the **Chat Client dropdown**, choose Gtalk and provide your **Chat User Name**. Upon saving, you can log into your Google Talk chat client and you'll notice multiple Formilla.com chat bot invitations. You will need to accept the chat invitations to start using your chat client with Formilla.com. Once you accept the invitations, your chat button should turn to "Chat with us" after a few moments. If you log off from your client, the button will automatically recognize you are no longer available and change to "Email us".


= Can I proactively initiate a live chat session with my customers? =
Yes.  Simply access your WordPress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  You can also access your Formilla Live Chat account outside of WordPress by going directly to Formilla.com.  Upon logging in, navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Option by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat** **-->** **View Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and **check** the **'Enable Auto Display'** field to configure proactive live chat from the **Advanced Options** tab.


= Can I require my site visitors to provide their email address before starting a live chat session? =
Yes.  To enable this setting, login to your Formilla Live Chat account and navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat** **-->** **Customize Chat Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and enable the "Require visitors to enter email before starting a chat" setting in the **Advanced Options** tab.


= Does Formilla Live Chat work with my mobile phone (e.g. iPhone, Android, etc.)? =
Yes.  We recommend using mobile chat clients (e.g. Trillian) for use with Google Talk to chat from your mobile phone on the go! For those using the live chat web interface, it is currently not optimized for chat from your mobile phone. We have plans on introducing mobile support in the near future. 


= How do I end a chat using my Google Talk client if the user does not end it? =
To end a live chat session, simply send ~end via your Google Talk chat client. It's important to end chats upon completion to ensure your chat queue can receive new chats as they may arrive at any time while you're online.


= Is Google Hangouts the same thing as Google Talk, and will it work with Formilla.com Live Chat software? =
Google Hangouts is different from Google Talk. Unfortunately Google Hangouts will not work via Formilla.com Live Chat. You can either revert back to Google Talk or use our alternative Live Chat web interface.  If you're using Google Talk and you're still not able to receive/send messages, please make sure you don't have the Hangouts plugin/extension installed in Chrome either, since it will conflict with Google Talk.


= Does the free live chat package allow me to use a smart phone to chat with my customers? =
Yes. Our free live chat package can be configured with any smart phone or tablet using Google Talk to send and receive chats.


= What happens when I choose the 'Request Chat' action from the visitor monitoring dashboard? =
Formilla Live Chat will pop-up the live chat window to the corresponding visitor of your web site after a few seconds or on the next page load.


= How does real-time visitor monitoring work? =
Check out our [real-time visitor monitoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XW3jgyGxyyc "real time visitor monitoring") video for a short tutorial of the functionality.

= Can I modify the message displayed to my website visitors when I request a chat with them via the visitor monitoring page? =
Yes.  Start by logging in to your Formilla Live Chat account and navigate to the Advanced Options tab of your live chat widget's settings.  You can then modify the 'Request Chat Text' from the current default message and save the changes.  


= Is real time visitor monitoring only available to Premium accounts? =
Yes.  Currently the real time visitor monitoring/tracking feature of Formilla Live Chat is a Premium Solo or Premium account offering only. 


= Do I need to refresh the visitor monitoring page to show me the latest status of visitors/users on my web site? =
No.  You will see the data automatically refresh the user information every few seconds to show you the latest visitors on your web site, what page they're currently on, how long the user has been on your web site, whether they are new or returning, and more. 


= How does the 30 chats/emails limit on the standard free live chat package work? =
At the 1st of every month, the total count of chats/emails is set to 0 for all standard free live chat customers.  Each chat conversation counts as 1 chat, as does every offline email submission you receive.  Formilla.com will send you an email once you reach 20 or more chats in a month, and another email once you've reached 30.  


= Does the Customer Inbox Help Desk come with the standard free live chat package? =
Yes.  Our standard free live chat customers can enjoy the Help Desk feature absolutely free!  You can read and respond to offline emails, view chat history, add private notes to chat conversations or emails, search, and more!


= Can I enable the desktop notifications feature with the standard free live chat package? =
Yes.  The desktop notifications feature works with the standard free live chat or premium package and can be enabled from within your Formilla.com account, under Account Settings.  Desktop notifications work with Firefox, Chrome, and Safari at this time.

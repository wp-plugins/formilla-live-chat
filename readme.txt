== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the Formilla 'Chat ID' under the wordpress plugin settings? =
The chat ID is simply the unique identifier for your particular live chat widget. Your live chat widget won't display on your wordpress website unless you have a Chat ID entered on the settings page.  You will receive this ID upon registering with Formilla.com via the **Formilla Chat** link on your wordpress admin panel.

= Can I specify my hours of operation or simply that I am unavailable to chat? =
Simply access your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat** **-->** **View Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and modify the hours of operation from the **Advanced Options** tab.


= How do I appear online for my customers to chat with me? =
Easy! Just access your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, you'll arrive on the **Live Chat** page and will appear online to your customers for chat during your defined business hours.  If you are not within your defined business hours, you will appear offline and the live chat button will turn into an offline "Email us" form.


= How do I appear unavailable so that customers cannot chat with me during that time? =
If you are currently not available to chat, just sign out of your Formilla.com Live Chat account and you will not receive any live chats during this time.  We took a very simple approach to appearing online versus offline for live chat.  If you are using Google Talk or Skype via Formilla.com Live Chat instead, simply sign out of your preferred client and Formilla.com will automatically update your status.      

= Is there a way for me to deactivate my live chat wordpress button momentarily without deactivating or removing the plugin? =
Yes.  Access your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat** **-->** **View Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and **uncheck** the **Active Widget** option on the **Widget Details** tab.  This will simply hide the live chat button from your wordpress site.  Once ready, just **check** the same box and the button re-appears! 

= How do I configure Google Talk (gtalk/gchat) or Skype chat instead of using the Formilla.com Live Chat standard offering? =
Setup either Google Talk or Skype chat by accessing your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, navigate to **Account Settings** **-->** **Manage Users** and select the edit icon for the appropriate account.  Under the **Chat Client** dropdown, choose either Gtalk or Skype accordingly and provide your **Chat User Name**.  Upon saving, you can log into your preferred chat client and you'll notice multiple Formilla.com chat bot invititations.  You will need to accept the chat invitations to start using your Gtalk or Skype account.   

= Can I proactively initiate a live chat session with my customers? =
Yes.  Simply access your wordpress admin panel and select the **Formilla Chat** link to access your Formilla.com Live Chat account.  Upon logging in, navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options by selecting from the menu as follows: **Live Chat** **-->** **View Widgets** then select the edit icon of your widget and **check** the **'Enable Auto Display'** field to configure proactive live chat from the **Advanced Options** tab.
